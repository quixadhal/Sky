How to install Skylib for windows:

1) Uncompress this package and move/rename the folder so that the folders like bin and mudlib
   are in c:\skylib

2) Use wordpad to edit c:\skylib\bin\config.win32 and change the mudname

3) Double-click on c:\skylib\win32\mud.bat

4) telnet to localhost 8000

5) Login using the following information:

       - login :    default
       - password : password

       NOTE: Note that before you put the mud on the net, you will
             want to demote or at least change the password of this
             character.  The best way would be to log in with another
	     character, promote them with "securitytool", and put
	     them in the "admin" domain, effectively making them
	     an admin.  After that it is safe to demote "default".

       If you do not follow the instructions above, the chances 
       are good that someone else will log in and take over your mud.

6) Review the information in the README, read the docs, play with your
   new mud, and have fun! If you have problems, post them in the Skylib
   area of http://lpmuds.net/forum

Note: The Windows port is experimental and does not support databases, 
external commands, nor compressed data.
