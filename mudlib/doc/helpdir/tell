.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Tell is used to tell someone something who is not in the room with you.  It
will tell the player the message in the following manner.  If you are Pinkfish
and you type 'tell shadow bing', shadow will receive the message

Pinkfish tells you: bing

This is the main way of communicating with people not in the same room as you
on the mud or in real life :)

The reply option to tell allows you to reply to the last person 
(or persons) to tell you something.  The people that told you is
remembered for 15 minutes.  Please remember that this is a very
dangerous way to chat and it is way open to mischats from someone
dropping in a random tell to you on the way.
