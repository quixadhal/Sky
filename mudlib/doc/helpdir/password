This command will prompt you for your old password then, assuming you get it
right, will let you enter your new password.  It will then ask you to type it
again to make sure you got it right the first time.  It then forces you to
save so your new password is immediately stored.

.SH Tips for choosing passwords
.SI 5
Choose sensible passwords.
Try not to use words in dictionaries such as words with non-standard
characters like numbers or punctuation.
Try to use upper and lower case letters or join different words together.
Do not use words that will be easily guessed like friends' and pets' names,
or the macros on your function keys like cast spell.
