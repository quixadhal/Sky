.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Allows you to make print runs of different sorts of leaflets, or
print new ones.  You can print off as many copies as you like of
the leaflet you wish.  If you claim copyright on a leaflet then
no one else can print off a leaflet that is the same or similar
to your leaflet.  This means that you control the printing rights
of the leaflet.

If the leaflet shop accepts it, it will translate leaflets into
different languages.

Once you have finished printing the leaflets you can collect the
finished leaflets from the collection office.  The printing and
collection services can be in the same or different rooms.
