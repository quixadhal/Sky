.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Allows you to scream out a warcry - especially useful before a big battle. Everyone else in the room with you will either be intimidated and show it, or not be scared at all and not give you a second thought.

If an npc is scared by your warcry, there is a random chance that he will be scared enough to run from the room.

Note - anyone with wimpy on will ALWAYS be scared.
