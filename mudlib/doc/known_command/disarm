.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to perform a disarming attack.  Note that you must
be in combat to perform this, and you must be concentrating on your
target (if you are fighting more than one enemy).  If your target is
wielding more than one weapon, it will be randomly decided which weapon
you attempt to disarm.  A successful disarm will cause your opponent to
lose control of his/her weapon.

There are four ways this command can be used in:

A mere 'disarm' will attempt to disarm whoever you are currently
concentrating on, and chooses a random weapon to disarm with, or attempts
to disarm unarmed, if you are not holding any.

With 'disarm with <weapon>' you can choose the weapon to disarm the person
you are concentrating on.

By using 'disarm <target>' you can specify the target to disarm with a
random weapon.

By using 'disarm <target> with <weapon>' you can specify both the target to
disarm and the weapon to disarm with.
