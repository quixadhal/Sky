.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Puts you in assault mode.

When you are in assault mode, you will be able to do extra unarmed attacks in combat even if you are wielding a weapon (or two). Your normal weapon attacks are unaffected.

Assault uses up a few gps every few seconds, and you can assault as long as you have gps to spend.

You may stop assaulting at any time by using the 'assault stop' command.
