.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Sneak is used when you want to furtively move from room to room.

This command is similar to hide, but will continue as you move.
The difficulty of the command is based on light levels and your skill.  You will move out
of the shadows if you use sneak stop, or if someone spots you.

You cannot sneak when you are in combat.
