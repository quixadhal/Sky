.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Allows you to perform a hurl attack.  Note that you must be in combat to perform this and you must be concentrating on your target (if you are fighting more than one enemy).

If you are fighting more than one enemy, you can use this attack to grab onto one opponent and throw him into the others, doing damage to each one of them.  You also receive a damage bonus for using hurl against more than one foe.

If you are fighting only one enemy, however, the damage is greatly reduced.
