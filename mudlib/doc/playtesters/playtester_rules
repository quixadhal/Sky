Playtesters have certain resposibilites due to their position.

The most important rule of all is that you may not discuss anything
at all that is being playtested with anyone except other playtesters,
no matter how well you know the person you're talking to.

Secondly, you may not use your badge to escape from combat. The
badge is for transportation to the playtester headquarters and to
areas being playtested, and not for any other reason.

Thirdly, if you act in a way un-becoming your position, or
otherwise abuse the playtester system, you will have to be
demoted. A lot of players look up to playtesters.

Fourthly, if you die or lose equipment while playtesting, it will
not automatically be returned to you. Unless it was lost due to a
bug, nothing can be done about it. However, if you do lose things
of value due to a bug, then by all means ask.

Finally, if you appear to not be taking your position seriously,
your status may be reviewed.
