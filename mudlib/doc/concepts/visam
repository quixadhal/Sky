Visam - The God of Life and Death.
.EP

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Where good and evil battle for control, a balance must be struck; this
has always been the task of Visam, the God of Life and Death, who is also
known as the Protector of the Circle of Life.  His priests are known for their
capabilities to balance out the differences between right and wrong, and are
also well in their power to invoke both on those who dare disturb the Balance.
.EP

.SP 5 5
As the battle between the numerous deities proceeded with awesome power and
destruction, Visam took it upon himself to protect the integrity of the
Balance, and therefore had no part in the battle itself. However, his
legendary sense of justice and righteousness earned him a permanent seat
amongst those who triumphed in the battle.  Many quarrels and disputes
are brought before him, as His Judgement is known to be fair and wise.

.SP 5 5
Not many have had the privilege of perceiving vision of Visam's appearance,
but legend goes that He equipped the grey Robe of Justice after his
appointment in the realm of deities and wields neither weapon nor pen, but only
the power of equity.
