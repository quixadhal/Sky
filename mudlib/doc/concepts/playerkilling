playerkilling

Overview
.SP 5 5
The level of interaction between players on $MUDNAME$ is controlled by
the status of 'player killer'.  By default players are not player
killers, which means that other players cannot kill them, steal from
them or loot their corpse.

Players who wish to do these things must register as player killers
(at the City Hall).  Once registered they will be able to do
these things to (and have these things done to them by) other player
killers.

Once you have decided to be a player killer, there is no turning back.

Warning
.SP 5 5
Becoming a player killer indicates your willingness to engage in this
level of player interaction.  However, it is not an indication by
others that they are prepared to be harassed.  $MUDNAME$ player
killing is not an 'anything goes' system, you are expected to continue
to behave in a reasonable manner, and others are expected to behave
that way towards you.
