.SP 5 5
In addition to the direct skill advances provided by the taskmaster,
completing quests (and doing some tasks) reward players with
experience points.  Additionally, experience points (xp) are gained
by killing monsters, by burying their corpses and by using Guild Commands.
These may be spent in advancing skills at the academy.
