Creators - those who are here to code things
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Creators are the immortals of $MUDNAME$.  The job of most creators is
to write code and to fix bugs.	Unless the MUD screws up they should
be considered to not even be present.  Their role is not to answer
questions for players, or even to replace lost equipment, it is to
develop and fix code.

Divided Sky is intended to be an experiential place.  That is you learn by
trying and doing, not by asking a creator.  Creators should not, and will
not, answer questions of the type 'what level do I need for xxx' or, 'are
there any quests in yyy', or even 'where is zzz', so please do not ask these
questions.

The members of the liaison domain will be more helpful towards newbies who
are getting acquainted with the mud, but experienced players should expect
to be told 'go find out for yourself'.

The flip side of this is that creators are not allowed to interfere with
players either directly or indirectly.	If a creator does such a thing you
should contact a Lord.
