.SH Description
.SP 5 5
During your travels on $MUDNAME$, there will be occasions when it is
necessary to fight.  You may be up against an aggressive monster which
is after the taste of your blood, or a mugger who is after the contents
of your purse; you may be fighting a duel with knives or taking part in
a joust.  Your ability to fight is determined by a set of skills and the
way in which you fight is determined by your tactics.

.SH Combat
.SP 5 5
Combat is made up of rounds, each of which follows the same pattern, and
each person in the fight gets one round every four to eight seconds of
real time.

During each round a set of attacks are attempted by the attacker; the
attacks available depend on the weapon or weapons that the attacker is
wielding and the successful use of each attack depends on the
attacker's bonus in the relevant skill for that weapon - you won't do
more damage with a "more powerful" weapon unless you have the skills
to match.

If an attack is successfully mounted, the target (the person the
attacker happens to be attacking this round) first attempts to dodge
(if dodging is part of the target's tactics); the success of the attempt
is determined by the target's bonus in f.c.dodging.melee versus the
skill of the attacker and an amount dependent on how much weight the
target is carrying - you'll be less able to dodge if you're kitted up in
very heavy armour, for instance.

If no attempt to dodge is made or if the attempt fails, the target then
attempts to parry (again, if parrying is part of the target's tactics);
the success of the attempt is determined by the target's bonus in
f.c.parry.held versus the amount of damage the attacker is trying to do
and an amount dependent on the weight of the weapon being used to parry.

If no attempt to parry is made or the attempt fails, the target is hit,
some of the damage being absorbed by the target's armour and the rest
of it damaging the target.

If the attacker is consistently much more skillful in the use of the
weapons than is required to mount a successful attack with them each
time, the attacker will get an extra attack that follows immediately.
