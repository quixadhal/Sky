.SP 5 5
Due to the way MudOS works every so often Divided Sky will need to
reboot.  When this happens the mud will shut down and everyone must
logoff.  The mud will be shut down for just a few minutes and then
will return.

Since $MUDNAME$ saves players inventories this should have no harmful
side-effects for you, but please, leave when Shutdown says there's just
a minute to go.
