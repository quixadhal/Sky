.SH Be careful
.SP 5 5
Because of the wide variety of backgrounds of $MUDNAME$ citizens, be
careful what you say and do towards other people until you know them
-- what to you may be lighthearted fun could, to someone else, be
intimidating and offensive.

.SH If you're harassed
.SP 5 5
If a player acts towards you in a manner that you consider to be
harassment, ask them to stop.  If they continue, notify a liaison
immediately.  If no liaison is online, ask any creator for help.
If no creators are available "ignore" the player and tell a liaison or
creator as soon as one is online.
.EP

.SH Sexual Harassment
.SP 5 5
Flirting or chatting sometimes leads to unwelcome advances.  One player
upsets another with souls or remotes.  In these gray areas, it is fairer
to the other player to say quickly: "Stop. I don't like that."  Speak
without using emote, souls or abusive language.  If someone says  "no,
stop", don't protest or question the person.  Say "I apologize."
Then leave the other player alone for awhile.
.EP

.SH Racial Harassment
.SP 5 5
The citizens of $MUDNAME$ come from all over the world, from all
racial backgrounds.  Treating someone badly or verbally abusing them
because of their racial or religious background is not acceptable and
will be treated like any other form of harassment.

.SH Game Harassment
.SP 5 5
Activities intended to ruin another players enjoyment of the game (for
example repeatedly killing them, burying their corpse, stealing their
kills etc.) is also harassment and unacceptable.
