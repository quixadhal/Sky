.SP 5 5
At the creation of the World, many forces attempted to seize control of
its reign.  Unlike most other gods, Lumen was not found amongst those
battling.  Instead, She devoted her powers to spiritual enlightment and
healing, therefore being a most valiant ally to those who were fighting
amongst themselves.  Depicted as a kind and warm middle-aged woman,
her image brings comfort and serenity to those who have the privilege
of seeing it.
