.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Your online age has little or no direct effect on the gaming experience
on $MUDNAME$, however there are a few things you should know and remember.

Characters on $MUDNAME$ get deleted when they have been idle (have not
logged on) for a specific period of time.  That time for characters
younger than 1 day is 30 days.  This means if you are younger than a day,
and haven't logged on for over a period of 30 days, you character will
be deleted.  This is to avoid having to store data for players who
probably won't return to the mud.  For characters older than 1 day, the
idle limit is proportional to their online age and is calculated by
multiplying their age by 30.

Characters that have not logged on for over 600 days will be deleted
whatever their age might be.

To know what your online age is, you can use the 'score' command.
