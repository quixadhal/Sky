int strcmp( string one, string two );

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This implementation of strcmp() is identical to the one found in C libraries.
If string `one' lexically precedes string `two', then strcmp() returns a number
less than 0.  If the two strings have the same value, strcmp() returns 0.
If string `two' lexically precedes string `one', then strcmp() returns a number
greater than 0.  This efun is particularly useful in the compare
functions needed by sort_array().

Note that relational operators ('<', '>', etc.) can also be used to compare
strings.
