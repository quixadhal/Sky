Synopsis

string break_string( string str | int foobar, int len,
                     void | int indent | string indent );

Description
.SP 5 5
This function breaks a continous string without newlines into a
a string with newlines inserted at every `len':th character. 
 
If `indent' is defined and is given as an integer, `indent' number
of spaces are inserted after every newline. If `indent' is a string 
that string is inserted before every newline.
 
If the first argument is an integer, the function simply returns 0.

break_string() is *not* context sensitive.  It does not take account
of periods '.' and new-lines '\\n'.  This means that the result is not
necessarily what you would expect.  My experience is that you should
use one space after a period and do not embed new-lines in the
text, but append them to the result of break_string().  If this format
does not meet your tastes you may find break_string() to be
inadequate.  A future revision of break_string() may allow different
line-breaking semantics.  (Cygnus)
