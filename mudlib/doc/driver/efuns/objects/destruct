void destruct( object ob );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Completely destroy and remove object `ob',  after the call to destruct().
If `ob' is this_object(), execution will continue, but it is best to return
a value immediately.  All pointers to the object in any variable or structure
will immediately become zero.  move_or_destruct() is called in all the
objects inside of the object being destructed.
