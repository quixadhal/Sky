.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The (ob, fun) syntax works as if (: call_other, ob, fun :) had been passed as
`f'.  Filter returns a new structure containing only the elements of `x' for
which the function returns nonzero.  Currently, it can be used on arrays and
mappings.  In the case of mappings, both the key and the value are passed
to the function.  `extra' and all the following arguments are passed to the
function after the element.  For example, filter(arr, fun, 2, 3) will
first call fun(x[0], 2, 3) then fun(x[1], 2, 3) etc.
