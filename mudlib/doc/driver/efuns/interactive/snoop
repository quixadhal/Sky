snoop() - snoop an interactive user
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
varargs object snoop( object snooper, object snoopee );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
When both arguments are used, begins snooping of `snoopee' by `snooper'.
If the second argument is omitted, turns off all snooping by `snoopee'.
Security for snoop() is normally controlled by a simul_efun.  snoop() returns
`snoopee' if successful in the two-argument case, and `snooper' if it was
successful in the single-argument case.  A return of 0 indicates failure.
The 'snoopee' must be an interactive object; the snooper can be any
object.  However, snooping with a non-interactive object is useless
unless the object defines a receive_snoop() function.
