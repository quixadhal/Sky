.SH Desription
.SP 5 5
enable_commands() marks this_object() as a living object, and allows
it to use commands added with add_action() (by using command()).
When enable_commands() is called, the driver also looks for the
local function catch_tell(), and if found, it will call it every time
a message (via say() for example) is given to the object.
