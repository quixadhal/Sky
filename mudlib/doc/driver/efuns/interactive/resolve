resolve() - resolve an internet address to domain name, or vice versa
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
int resolve( string address, string callback_func );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
resolve() resolves `address', which should be an internet address in the form
"127.0.0.1" or a domain name, into its domain name, or internet address.
When the resolve is complete, `callback_func' will be called in the
current object.  The form of the callback is:
.EP

.SI 5
void callback( string address, string resolved, int key );
.EI

.SP 5 5
`key' will match up with the number that the call to resolve() returned.
`address' will be the domain name of the host, and `resolved' the dotted
decimal ip address.  The unknown value will be 0 if the lookup failed.
