command() - execute a command as if given by the object

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
int command( string str );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Execute `str' for the object this_object() as a command (matching against
add_action()s and such).  The object must have called enable_commands() for
this to have any effect.
In case of failure, 0 is returned, otherwise a numeric value is returned,
which is the LPC "evaluation cost" of the command.  Bigger numbers mean
higher cost, but the whole scale is subjective and unreliable.
