message() - deliver messages to "living" objects

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
void message( mixed class, string message, mixed target,
              mixed exclude );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
message() calls receive_message(mixed class, mixed message) in all objects
in the `target' list excluding those in the `exclude; list.  This basically
tells the object the message.

Class is the type of message (used for clients and such).  An example
would be 'combat', 'shout', 'emergency' etc.  Any LPC value can be
passed, though.

Message is usually a string containing the text to send, though it
can also be any value.

`target' is a list of objects to be sent the message.  This can be either a
single object string or object pointer, or may be an array of either.
If a target is non-living all objects in its environment will receive
the message.

`exclude' is a list of objects that should not receive the message.  This
can either be one object or an array of objects.
