.SH Name

throw() - forces an error to occur in an object
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
void throw( mixed arg );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Throw can be used to send an arbitrary value to an enclosing catch() statement.
If you want to raise a general error message, see error(), as that will
behave better if it is not caught.  Control is transfered directly to the
enclosing catch() statement, and the value of the catch() statement is the
value thrown.

.SH Example
   string err;
   int rc;

   err = catch(rc = ob->move(dest));
   if (err) {
        throw("move.c: ob->move(dest): " + err + "\\n");
        return;
   }
