call_out() - delayed function call in same object
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
void | int call_out( string | function fun, int delay, mixed arg, ... );
.EI

.SH Description

Set up a call to `fun'.  If fun is a string, it is interpreted as the
name of a function in this_object().  The call will take place `delay'
seconds later, with the arguments `arg' and following provided.
.EP

.SH Notes
.SP 5 5
Unless THIS_PLAYER_IN_CALL_OUT is defined, you can't rely on
write() or say() in 'fun' since this_player() is set to 0.
Use tell_object() instead.

If THIS_PLAYER_IN_CALL_OUT is defined, this_player() is the same as
it was when the call_out() call was scheduled.

The return value will be a unique integer identifying the call_out, if
CALLOUT_HANDLES is defined.  This 'handle' can be passed to
remove_call_out() and find_call_out().

The driver Divided Sky uses has THIS_PLAYER_IN_CALL_OUT and CALLOUT_HANDLES
defined.
