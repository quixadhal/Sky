.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Get information about all pending call outs.  An array is returned,
where every item in the array consists of 3 elements: the object,
the function, and the remaining delay.

Note: due to security concerns, and the fact that call_outs may now
have an arbitrary number of arguments, the 4th element of the return
value was removed.  The security concerns stem from the fact that if
the arguments where types which can be modified (arrays, mappings,
etc.), obtaining them would allow them to be modified before the
function was called.  It is possible this will be fixed in the
future if there is enough interest.
