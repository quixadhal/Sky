.SH Name

replaceable() - determine whether any functions are defined at this level
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
int replaceable( object ob );
int replaceable( object ob, string *fnames );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
In the second form, return 0 if the program for object `ob' defines any
functions explicitly, as opposed to simply inheriting.  Function names
in the array `fnames' are ignored.  If no such functions are defined, 1
is returned.  If the second argument is omitted, it defaults to
({ "create" }).  The purpose of this efun is to assist in making
automatic decisions on whether to call replace_program().  Note that
the default version ignores create(), so it is only safe to replace a
object for which replaceable() returns true if you never intend to
clone from that object.
