Creator Rules

.SH The Rules

.SP 5 5
Creators have rules above and beyond those that players are required
to follow, due to the extra power that they enjoy.
.EP

.SH General Rules

.SP 5 5
Creators represent the mud and are expected to serve as role models
for appropriate behaviour.  Thus all creators are expected to read
'help rules' and abide by them.  Ignorance of this document is not
an acceptable excuse.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Creators should always use respect in their dealings with each
other and the player base.  This includes communication on channels
and in tells, as well as every other method of communication offered
by $MUDNAME$.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Creators are allowed to code on other muds, however it is expected
that they tell admin where they are coding, and by which names. 
Sufficient effort to be part of this team is also expected.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Code placed in the mud or mudlib belongs to $MUDNAME$.  Mudlib
code will normally be given freely to other muds, but permission
must be granted by admin, with all admin being informed. 
Reciprocal transfers of mudlib code from the other mud would be
expected.  Transfer of non-mudlib code to other muds will depend
on the circumstances, with all admin agreeing to the transfer.
.EP

.SP 5 5
We have a liberal read and ftp policy.  This is to encourage
creators to download and study files for learning purposes,
however, to maintain this policy we count on creators not to
give out code to others, and to follow the above guidelines.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Ideas for the mud should be discussed with the appropriate domain
leader.  Work begun within a domain must always meet the approval
of the domain leader.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Creators must always ask the other party before using 'trans' or
'goto'.  The only exceptions to this are in cases of discipline
being handled by liaisons.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Snoops may only be used with permission, and for valid reason. 
Normally only liaisons would ever need to use snoop on players.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Creator titles set with 'cretitle' or by any other method must
not imitate any status that you do not currently have.  For
example, you may not have a creator title saying you are 
'(Invisible)' or an '(Admin)'.  It is also generally a good
idea to not use another creator's name in your title.  Finally,
creator titles may not contain profanity, or be used to express
displeasure with mud policy or any member of the creator team.
.EP

.SH Interaction with Players

.SP 5 5
Creators may not assist players, except to correct something
that is not working correctly.  This is a grey area, it is
best to leave such interactions with the players to liaisons.
.EP

.SP 5 5
The privacy of players is tantamount.  Revealing information
on a player's location to other players is not allowed.  Calls
should not be made on players except for legitimate purposes. 
Always have a player's permission before using 'goto'.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Players should only be transed if they are stuck in a location
with no exits due to a bug.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Creators should never play the game as creators.  Rather they
should have both a player alt and a testing alt.  Game
development by the creator should be tested with the testing
alt, who should never enter the live sections of the mud. 
It is forbidden to assist your player alt.
.EP

.SH Absences and Contribution

.SP 5 5
If you will be absent for more than 30 days, you should post
to the absences board, and discuss your absence with your
domain leaders.  Any creator who fails to do this, and is
idle for more than 30 days, may be demoted without further
warning.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Apprentices who fail to complete REQS within one month may
be demoted if a written request for an extension of time
is not submitted to the lords of the learning domain.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Regarding absences, communication is the key.  We understand
that there are a variety of reasons that you may experience
an absence from $MUDNAME$.  However, we need to know about it.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Creators are encouraged to contribute to the mud in the area
that best suits their talents and strengths, whether it be
through coding, writing text, teaching or in some other area. 
Sages do not have this requirement, though we are happy to
have their assistance as they have time and energy.  We ask
that those who do not have time to contribute regularly even
in some small fashion discuss this with their domain leader
who will decide what immortal status might suit the
circumstances best.
