Donations for the running costs of Divided Sky.

With the current host, it is costing me 30 dollars US a month.  While I am happy paying this myself, I have had a few people asking me about donating.  This is always welcome, but in no way necessary to get anywhere in this mud.

This help file is here for the purpose of explaining just what donating to the cost of the server gets you.

You recieve :
     * Your name in a help file saying you contributed to the running costs of the mud.
     * A warm feeling in your heart.
     * Nothing else.

This will never be a mud where you get extra levels or equipment for donating (players) or higher rank (creators).  People who don't donate have just as much chance of advancement as people who do.  I would rather pay the whole lot by myself than introduce those sorts of problems and inequalities.

Donations can be made to myself, or straight to the host provider (Just ask me for the details).  For some people it might be better value sending it straight to the host with exchange rates etc.. (it actually costs me 60 aussie dollars a month.) but if we do that we should try to organise it together as it is cheaper to buy three months at once, and cheaper still to 6 months or a year upfront.)

Again I stress, donations are not neccessary, I am happy to continue paying the full amount.

Cheers
