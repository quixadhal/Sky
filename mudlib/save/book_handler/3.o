Note that Liaison     Cre's should also mail the Lords of the Domain and Guilds that they     are liaising for, and ask to be added to those Domains.  Also,     remember that as a Cre, you can access mail from anywhere, without     having to find a Post Office. "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Workroom%^RESET%^     In your home directory you will find a default workroom, which will           contain a few useful items. You can get there with 'goto workroom'     as long as you are logged in to your home directory.  I would     suggest creating an 'alias home goto /w/yournamehere/workroom'     command to take you there from where ever you are. "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Workroom contents%^RESET%^     Once in your workroom, have a look at the bookcase.  On it you                should find a couple of books and several other items.  These are     Presto's Wand, a Green Jade Scarab, Obilix's Resurrector, Ceres'     Transporter, an Arcane Instrument, a Gagger and a Typewriter. These     are very useful items, because they will allow you to start using     some creator abilities without having to hunt for the necessary     calls.  Their uses are described on the next few pages.A "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Olorin's Green Jade Scarab%^RESET%^     This is the simplest of the items.  Simply wear it, and you become            invulnerable to attack.  A terribly useful way to gauge how     destructive that new critter is... "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Ceres' Transporter (Small grey disk)%^RESET%^     This handy little device opens a portal from you, to a specified              player.  The portal remains open until either the player returns to     their original location through it, or you use the teleporter to     manually close the portal.  It has 3 operating commands: transport     <player>, force <player>, and release. Transport player opens the     portal, allowing the player to enter or not, force player opens the     portal and pulls them into the portal, and release close the portal     manually. "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Obilix's Resurrector%^RESET%^     A one command wonder, this device allows you to resurrect a player,           without having to figure out the necessary calls.  Simply carry the     resurrector, and use the command 'resurrect <player>'. "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Presto's Wand%^RESET%^     Probably the single most useful item I've found, Presto's wand is             set up to allow a creator to replace a player's missing items     without having to hunt though the various directories to find the     correct file.  It also advises the user when the requested     replacement might not fit the normal guidelines, for example,     replacing items for a level 300+ character, or an amount of money     greater than the recommended A$30. A creator can also determine     which items are eligible for replacement simply by reading the wand.          The command syntax is 'replace <item> for <player>' "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Presto's Editor%^RESET%^     This typwriter is an alternative to the built-in editor Ed.  As long          as you are carrying it, you may use it as a file editor simply by     using the syntax 'edit <file>' or 'edit <object>'.  Within the     editor type 'H' for more help. "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Obilix's Gagger%^RESET%^     This device is to be used sparingly, if at all.  All uses of the              gagger are logged.  The purpose of the gagger is to remove the     ability to chat or shout from obnoxious or abusive players.  Please     make sure that the player has been warned before resorting to this     measure.  If the warning is ignored, feel free. :-) "," %^BOLD%^start book                  Discworld Creator help                  start book%^RESET%^%^BOLD%^Jeremy's Arcane Instrument%^RESET%^     This is a very useful device used to track and compare player's idle          and active times over a period of time.  This is mostly useful in     providing evidence of multi-playing, where one character will sit     idle until the player switches to that character.  With this tool     and a bit of on the scene observation one can investigate claims of     multiplaying. ",}),"owner":"sandoz",])
