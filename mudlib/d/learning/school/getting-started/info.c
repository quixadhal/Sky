Ok, the very first thing you need to decide before you
start learning anything is, what kind of method are you
going to use to create your files.  There are a few
available, but i'll list only two that i think are worth
thinking about right now.

1. The ed utility.

The ed is an in-game editing utility which can be pretty
hard to use at the beginning but when you get a hang of it,
it will be very handy.  However, I don't recommend you start
with this.  If you insist, you should go back and choose
the edtutor exit.

2. FTP

You need two things to use FTP for transferring files.  The
first one is an FTP-client, there are many good ones around
the net which are also free.  The second is some kind of text
editing program, notepad for example.  Now when you have these,
you can create the files at home with notepad/whatever and FTP
them here.  The FTP address is divided-sky.dynu.com at port 7302.
Log in with your character name and password.  You will be put
directly into your home directory.

Ok, when you have decided, it's time to move on.
