    Shiannar - 25 May '02

    after each error, just in case.
    Sandoz - 25 May '02
/secure/simul_efun/debug.c - Changed tell_object(.. in tell_creator to
    TO->tell_object, so it wouldn't use the efun tell_object.
    Sandoz - 26 May '02
/global/player.c - Changed write("Saving your inventory.\n"); to tell_object(
    TO, "Saving your inventory.\n");, because otherwise it will look very odd
    in a reboot if TP is the one initiating the shutdown, not the player being
    saved.
    Sandoz - 26 May '02
/global/player.c - Changed a couple more write() to tell_object( TO..., and
    fixed an oversight with su'ing not saving the player.  Now to fix the help
    file for su.
    Sandoz - 26 May '02
/handlers/weather.c - Sped up a few things, and made the rooms mapping survive
    updates.
    Sandoz - 26 May '02
/std/room/basic/room_base.c - Fixed the problems with changing_to_day/night (I
    think...), and removed the replace_program code, because it didn't work
    with too many things anyway.
    Sandoz - 26 May '02
/global/player.c - fixed a tell_object so it had an object and didn't error
    line 778
    Shaydz - 26 May '02
/std/shops/leaflet_shop.c - Fixed a couple of odd messages in do_collect.
    Sandoz - 27 May '02
/include/crime.h - Changed the description string for the SLAUGHTER crime type

/std/npc/npc_main.c - Added get_item() to fetch items from the armoury.
    Sandoz - 27 May '02

    test_remove(), when the sack should break, and tries to move everything
    out of the sack, and looping test_remove().
    Sandoz - 28 May '02

    Sandoz - 28 May '02

/obj/monster/death.c - Death lives is the void now, instead of all over the
    mud.

    crashes us (starting line 181).  If mem usage gets too bad, we can
    uncomment it.
    Sandoz - 30 May '02
/std/npc/npc_main.c - Changed them to make less callouts during setup and
    changed event_move_object() to remove do_follow_move callout, so that
    grouped NPCs would follow properly, and not run past the chasee.  Also
    removed the inactive move limiting code, and stopped start_attack() being
    called out when the NPCs aggressive mode is off.
    Sandoz - 30 May '02
/handlers/map.c - Fixed up query_zones().  It was calling query_movezones() on
    rooms, instead of query_zones(), which means it _always_ got zones from
    cache, never from the actual room if one was loaded.
    Sandoz - 30 May '02
/std/npc/npc_main.c - Added do_not_wander() that can be overwritten to stop
    NPCs from wandering temporarily.  Adding a "no wander" property to an NPC

    Sandoz - 30 May '02

    Sandoz -  1 Jun '02
/std/living/living.c - run_away() will now set this_player() to this_object(),
    so we won't runtime when the combat effect, which has no this_player(),
    makes us wimpy.
    Sandoz -  1 Jun '02
/std/effects/fighting/combat.c - Fixed the thing with "XXX misses you." which
    was printed after you had wimpied into another room.
    Sandoz -  1 Jun '02
/obj/armours/doublemail/doublemail_mittens.c - , plus everything else in this
    directory - removed set_main_plural(), because the mud pluralizes them
    correctly (except the doublemail coif ).
    Sandoz -  1 Jun '02
/obj/clothes/brown_leather_trousers.c - Made them a group object.
    Sandoz -  2 Jun '02

    Sandoz -  6 Jun '02
/obj/clothing.c - Added query_scabbard_mess() so that the scabbard message
    could be used externally.
    Sandoz -  7 Jun '02

    Sandoz -  8 Jun '02

    of find_object("/secure/related_files") in a check.
    Sandoz - 11 Jun '02
/std/shops/leaflet_shop.c - Removed the save_dir code and handlerised it, so

/global/player.c - Changed the _hb_num check in heart_beat from if( _hb_num++
    > 1800 ) to if( ++_hb_num >= 1800 ), so that we wouldn't get 1800 and 0 in

    Sandoz - 26 Jun '02
/global/player.c - Also changed check_announcements() to not give a message if

/global/player/start_position.c - Cleaned up inform_entered_game, and added a
    check to add_start() so that it wouldn't accept empty strings as start
    positions, which break player files pretty badly.

    Sandoz - 30 Jun '02
/obj/dwclothes/baggy_trousers.c - ,white socks.c - Made them into group
    objects.
    Sandoz - 30 Jun '02
/std/stationery/leaflet.c - , folder.c Moved to here from /obj/stationery/
    because they are inherits.
    Sandoz - 30 Jun '02
