This is the written testimony of Balsof, scribe and scholar, recording the
details of the foundation of Calarien, capital city of Delsance, in the 
year 21 After Sundering.

I shall put these events to paper without prejudice, emotion or bias.
All that I shall commend to these pages will be that which I myself have
witnessed, or have been told by those who were witness and whom I find to be
a reliable source for this information.

May Savons, god of knowledge and learning, guide my pen as I drag it
through this chaos of history.

Balsof.
