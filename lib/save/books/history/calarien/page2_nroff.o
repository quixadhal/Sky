Let us build a place where we can rest andgather our strength.  Let us grow grain and plough the land,and let us grow in number.  For it is clear for all to see thatVisam himself has guided us here, to strike the balance againstall the horror that the world has seen; such beauty as thiscan only be the work of the Gods themselves.'After having spoken thus, he knelt down and offered a prayer to those who watch over land, sea, air and man.",})
