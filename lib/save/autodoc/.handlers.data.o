main_docs (["main":({"Universal data initialization handler.The data initializer can be used to initialize databases for use in otherhandlers.  The database is defined in a user-provided text file, witha format similar to the virtual object compiler.  The input file isconverted to a temporary object, which allows fairly complicatedexpressions to be used as data values.  The initializer can handlearrays and mappings (nested to any level (theoretically)), with a baseelement of any type, including mixed and classes.<p>To initialize a variable, assign it the value returned bycompile_data() in the initializer.  compile_data() takes an array offilenames as its only argument.<p><b>File format</b>The data file uses the following keywords.  Each keyword is followedby the required data.  The data can be spread over multiple lines,following the same rules as for LPC code, but the keywords must be atthe beginning of the line (preceded by optional whitespace).<dl><dt>::data:: < array | mapping > [ of ] ... < base ><dd>This keyword defines the structure of the data.  The word \"of\" isoptional.  \"array\" and \"mapping\" may be repeated as many times asdesired.  \"base\" is the base type of the data.  For classes, it wouldbe of the form \"class <classname>\".  For types other than classes,the base isn't reallyused at this time, but something needs to be there to keep the parserin line.  Some examples:<b><pre>::data:: array of mapping of array of int::data:: mapping of mapping of mixed::data:: mapping of array of class myclass</pre>There should only be one ::data:: keyword in the list of files passedto compile_data().  Also, note that classes need to be defined beforethis statement.  This can be done either with ::quote:: or::#include::.<dt>::item <index> [,] ... :: [ value ]<dd>This keyword defines the value for one item of the data.  <index> isrepeated as often as necessary, given the structure declared in the::data:: statement.  For mappings, the index can be any valid mapping key.For arrays, the index can be either a number, or the strings i, i++,or ++i, for current index, current index (incrementing afterwards), ornext index.  The value can (and probably should) be omitted forclasses, with the field values specified with the \"->\" keyword below.Examples (corresponding to the three ::data:: examples above):<pre>::item 0, \"item 1\", 2:: 42::item \"a\", \"b\":: ({ 1, \"fred\", ({ 2, 3 }) })::item \"x\" i++::</pre><dt> ::-><field>:: <value><dd>This allows the fields of items of type class to be assignedindividually.  In general, the preceding ::item:: keyword should nothave been given a value.  The class must have been defined previously,either with an ::#include:: directive, or with the ::quote:: keyword.Examples:<pre>::Quote::class item_data {    string *season;    mixed  quant;    string ob;}::Data:: mapping of class item_data:item \"white clover\"::::->season:: ({ \"spring\" })::->quant:: ({ 3, 4 })::->ob:: \"/std/plant\"</pre>These statements set the season, quant, and ob fields of the mapping<dt>::quote:: <LPC code><dd>This keyword allows specific LPC statements to be inserted in theobject that creates the database.  To use this effectively requires alittle understanding of the translation process.  First, all linesassociated with a given keyword are folded into one line.  This meansthat using the \"//\" comment delimiter in a ::quote:: will cause theremainder of the quoted statements to be ignored.  Second, theprototype of the function that returns the data isn't written untilthe ::data:: keyword is encountered.  Therefore, any \"global\"statements (such as class definitions) should be included or quotedbefore the ::data:: line.  The easiest way to see what's going on isto try a few examples and look at the resulting .c file (which is thefirst data file name with \".c\" stuck on the end).</dl>",}),"author":({"Jeremy",}),"example":({"mixed data;data = \"/handlers/data\"->compile_data(({ \"/save/file1.dat\",     \"/save/file2.dat\" }));// This will catenate the two files into one, translate it, and return// the data.  Of course, someone has to create the data files also.",}),])
