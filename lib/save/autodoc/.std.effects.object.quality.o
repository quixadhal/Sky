main_docs (["main":({"This effect is used to impart the attribute of \"quality\" upon anobject, be it weapon, armour or normal object.  There are a couplemain effects of quality upon an object:<ul><li><b>Sturdiness</b>. A higher quality object will suffer less damagethan it would normally. Lower quality suffers more damage.<li><b>Value</b>. A higher quality object is worth more. Lower qualitybrings a lower price.<li><b>Damage Inflicted</b>. A higher quality weapon has better balance,holds a better edge (for sharp weapons), has a better designedstriking surface (for blunt weapons), and better grips, and thuswill do more damage than a normal weapon.  A low quality weapon,on the other hand, might have a loose handle, poor edge or evena warped blade.<li><b>Enchantment potential</b>. A higher quality weapon, due to itssuperior form and structure, will hold a higher enchantment thansomething put together by some drunken twonk from Slice.<li><b>Appearance</b>. The quality of the item is obvious to those whoinspect it.</ul>All these modifications to normal behavior are on a logarithmic scale,thus the range of possible quality numbers ranges from +infinity to-infinity, but in actual practice only +10 to -10 are meaningful.Even so, the further you get from quality 0 (normal in all respects)the more rare it should be.  Most shopkeepers will not carry poorquality merchandice unless they are in dire straits, and there areextremely few people on the disc capable of even approaching the upperquality ratings.  Even then, they only do so by the grace of the Gods.",}),"started":({"Sun 2200 22 Mar 1998",}),"author":({"Daxa (Greg Craff)",}),"classification":({"object.quality",}),"example":({"wossname->add_effect(EFFECT_PATH+\"object/quality.c\",4)",}),])
