.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The training hall is the place where you can learn specific skills.

The cost of skills and the level to which you can learn them in a
training hall is determined by your stats in the specific skill.

The various cost commands will tell you how much it will cost to raise
your skills by various amounts, and the 'advance' command will actually
raise your skills.

With all the skill names you can abbreviate their name down to the
smallest unique match.  For example, fighting.combat.melee can be
abbreviated to fi.co.me, faith.points to fa.po etc.
