.SH Description
.SP 5 5
In a parcel office you can send parcels to other people and
receive parcels yourself.

Prior to sending a parcel you have to put the things you want
to send in suitable packaging, i.e. an envelope or wrapping
paper.  You can check the cost of sending a specific parcel
to a specific office for a specific player with the 'cost'
command, while 'list offices' gives you the list of possible
post offices you can send the parcel to.

To collect a parcel you must use the 'collect' command,
which collects the parcel that was sent to you the
earliest.  You can only collect one parcel at a time,
so please pay attention to what the parcel clerk tells you.
