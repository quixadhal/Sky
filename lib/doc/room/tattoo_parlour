.SH Description
.SP 5 5
A tattoo parlour allows you to get a tattoo.  All you need to do is to
decide what you want tattooed, and pick a bodypart you want it drawn on.
Keep in mind that the tattooist doesn't differentiate between tattoos with
an article and one without one, so you will need to add one yourself,
if needed.

For example 'request a flaming cabbage on my left arm' will later appear as
"He has a tattoo of a flaming cabbage on his left arm.", while
'request crossed needles on my right right forearm' will appear as
"She has a tattoo of crossed needles on her right forearm.".

It is also possible to request several tattoos, and depending on the parlour,
tattoo removal is also an option.
