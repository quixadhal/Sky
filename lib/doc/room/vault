.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The vault lets you store your things in a safe, guarded place.
There are two types of vaults on $MUDNAME$ - one with no upkeep
costs, but a fee which must be paid each time you want to visit
the vault, and one with monthly upkeep costs, but not visiting
costs.  The vaults with a monthly fee are generally larger than
the ones with visiting costs.

If you are renting a vault with upkeep costs, and fail to pay
your rent in time, your things will be sold to general stores,
with the exception of quest rewards which will be returned to
you, so we urge you to be mindful of your vaults.  You will
receive a notification by mudmail two weeks before your vault
will be closed.

While opening a vault account, you will need to choose the size
of the vault you want to rent.  To pick an appropriate vault
size, you should consider how often you would be using the vault
and how much things you would store in it.  To get the list of
available vault sizes and their fees, please 'check prices'.

You can change the size of your vault at any time from a smaller
one to a larger one, or vice versa.  While doing so, you will
have to pay the difference between the opening costs, and any
rent that you have paid in advance for your current vault space
will be subtracted from that.  If you switch to a smaller vault
space, any things that refuse to fit into your new vault will
be returned to you.
