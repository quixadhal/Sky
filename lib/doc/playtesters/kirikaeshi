.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Allows you to perform a kirikaeshi attack on a target.  Kirikaeshi is an ancient skill, but only recently have the researchers at the Calarien Academy come up with a modern application for it.  A kirikaeshi attack is a series of stronger-than-normal attacks on a target.

Its quick nature and the fact that it allows the fighter to hit harder blows makes kirikaeshi the ideal way to initiate combat with an opponent.  It is only possible to use two-handed weapons for the kirikaeshi attack.
