Armour is an important part of combat here on $MUDNAME$.  It can vary
from a light cloth shirt you might pick off a thieves corpse, all the way
to thick, heavy plate.  Armour comes in all shapes and sizes; it includes
protective head gear, body armour, boots, and even a few odds and ends, like
belts and gloves.  Aside from using armour to protect your character, you
can also make yourself more defensive in combat, using the tactics command.
