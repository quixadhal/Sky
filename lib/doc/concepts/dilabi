.SH Description
.SP 5 5
One of the most destructive and feared deities to ever have ruled in the
realm of gods, Dilabi is he who has power over all that corrupts and poisons.
His priests are feared for their capabilities to bring doubt and chaos to
their enemies.  Their powers are often drawn from within their victims, using
it to bring advantage upon themselves, though not without a price to pay.

.SP 5 5
At the very creation of the World, Dilabi had immediately begun to spread
corruption and malice amongst his opponents, clouding their thoughts and
bringing doubt into their minds.  Known to wield poison and disease to achieve
his goals, many feared his power to bring decay, which allowed him to take the
seat amongst those who were victorious in the battle.

.SP 5 5
To the best knowledge of even the wisest of men, there is no icon nor
depiction of Dilabi anywhere in the world.  However, he is often symbolized
by a hand dripping poison in a cup, symbolizing His power to bring disease and
death in secrecy.
