Savons - The God of Knowledge and Learning.

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Those who follow Savons are well-known for their extensive knowledge and
wisdom.  Because of their tremendous insight on intellectual matters, they
are virtually undefeatable on matters of the mind. Savonites also have a
well-earned reputation as advisors of all sorts and ranks.
.EP

.SP 5 5
During the clash of the deities to take control over the newly-created World,
Savons was a feared opponent to many.  His wisdom and seemingly unstoppable
knowledge was often the source of the destruction of one of the lesser deities
who were powerless against his devious tactics. Though Savons is also known
for his kindness, his fury, when invoked, can be most disastrous.

.SP 5 5
Many images of Savons can be found on the World, most of them presenting
him as an old and grey-haired pilgrim, with a look of utter serenity and
understanding in his eyes.
