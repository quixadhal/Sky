General Rules

.SH Player Rights

.SH Purpose

.SP 5 5
These rights are detailed here to enable players to know which
rights they go under on $MUDNAME$.  However, these rights do
not, and never will, provide a loophole to avoid punishment
for rule-breaking.
.EP

.SH Tells

.SP 5 5
You have the right to know when your tell history is being checked. 
This notification happens automatically when it occurs, and your tell
history can only be checked by Lords or higher.  Furthermore, this
will only happen with your permission, or to confirm a harrassment
case that another person has brought against you.
.EP

.SH Say

.SP 5 5
You have the right to know when your say history is being checked. 
This notification happens automatically when it occurs, and your
say history can only be checked by Admin. Furthermore, this will
only happen with your permission, or to confirm a harassment
case that another person has brought against you.
.EP

.SH Snoop

.SP 5 5
You have the right to know when you are being snooped unless by
a Lord or higher. Furthermore, Lords and higher will almost never
use a quiet snoop except in the most exceptional of circumstances. 
Notification of being snooped will occur when snooping is started,
and will include the name of the creator who is snooping you. 
Snoop is usually used only to confirm a bug, or a harassment case.
.EP

.SH Entrapment

.SP 5 5
Many of you may be familiar with the notion of entrapment.  In
basic summary, it is enticing someone to do something illegal
that normally they would avoid doing.  The notion of entrapment
does not exist upon $MUDNAME$, however, no creator may take
more than a passive role in confirming a break in the rules.
.EP

.SH Summary

.SP 5 5
As stated before, a break in these rights does not grant you
immunity from punishment from breaking the rules.  However, these
are the rules all creator/player interactions are governed by. 
If for any reason you feel your rights are being compromised,
please mail Admin with ALL pertinant information.  Please
remember that persecution of those that break the rules will
outweigh the rights of the individual, as the most important
right of all is for those who abide by the rules to have their
enjoyment of the game free from compromise by those who break
the rules.
