.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The goddess Elytra has always had a place among the gods, as it is she
who seduces and tempts all those susceptible to her charms into vice and sin.
Her powers lie in deception and charm, which she uses to all extent to
achieve her own personal goals.  Those who follow her have many ways to
tempt others into sin and evil, and are known to seduce those who oppose
them towards their own doom.

One of the most feared deities in the battle over the World, Elytra tempted
many of her opponents, and turned allies upon each other, spreading hate
and lies.  Often she herself has been responsible for the fall of those
who could not compete in the Godly battle, drawing them into a deadly
fate through use of her evil charms.

.SP 5 5
The image of Elytra is well-known to almost every living being in the World,
as they are taught to recognize her beauty, as to prevent them from
falling for her trickery. Eyes of the purest emerald and hair as black as
coal, many fall for her fatal charms.
