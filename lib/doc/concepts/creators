Creators

.SH Name
.SI 5
Creators - those who are here to code things
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Creators are the volunteers who write code and generally maintain $MUDNAME$. 
Unless there is an emergency of some sort, it is rare for creators to be
visibly present, and when creators are visible please note that they may
not be in the mood to chat.  However, they usually are as friendly a person
as any you could meet.

$MUDNAME$ is intended to be a place where knowledge is obtained through
experience.  That is you learn by trying and doing, not by asking a
creator.  Creators should not, and will not, answer questions of the type
'what level do I need for xxx' or, 'are there any quests in yyy', or even
'where is zzz', so please do not ask these questions.

The members of the liaison domain will be more helpful towards newbies who
are getting acquainted with the mud, but experienced players should expect
to be told 'go find out for yourself'.

The flip side of this is that creators are not allowed to interfere with
players either directly or indirectly.  If a creator does such a thing you
should contact a Lord.

.SH Structure
.SP 5 5
There are multiple levels of creator on $MUDNAME$, however, these should
only be considered indicators of responsibility and experience.  No creator
should ever 'pull rank' over another creator, except in domain or discipline
related incidences.

.SI 2
Project Leader:
.SI 5
Projects are small undertakings independent of management by a
domain lord due to the nature of the task at hand.  To ensure that
the project is completed successfully, a project leader is appointed
to run the project.
.EI

.SI 2
Lord:
.SI 5
Lords are assigned to one or more domains, and are in charge of
everything that occurs within that domain's boundaries.  No project
should occur within that domain without the knowledge and consent
of the domain lord, as it is their duty to keep everything organised
and working correctly.
.EI

.SI 2
Admin:
.SI 5
Admin are responsible for ensuring that $MUDNAME$ as a whole runs
correctly.  To this end they may or may not be in charge of multiple
domains, or they may work independently of any domain.  They are
also considered the last court of appeal in regards to any
disciplinary issues, though any person wishing to take up with
them will be informed of the correct time to do so.

Furthermore, admin are to be scrupulous in their actions.  Any
untoward actions from an admin should be reported to the other
admin so it may be dealt with.
.EI

.SH Projects
.SI 5
Projects are tasks that occur independently of any currently
existing domain.  Usually the project is disbanded once the task
is carried out, though occasionally a project will persist as
a continually developing item.
.EI

.SH Domains
.SI 5
$MUDNAME$ is divided into separate areas for management.  These areas 
are called domains.  Each creator works for one or more domains. 
There is a special domain called liaison.  The members of liaison have
a special role which is explained in help liaisons.
