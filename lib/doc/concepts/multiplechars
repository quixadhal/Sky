Multiple Characters

.SH Overview
.SP 5 5
We believe the MU in MUD stand for Multi and User respectively.  As
such, the environment of the mud allows real people to interact with
other real people in a fantasy or theme environment.  Logging multiple
characaters to better yourself either by giving money, equipment or
skills, or using one character to assist another in any way, detracts
from this.  Simply defined, it would be cheating.  Therefore
any infringement would result in removal of all your characters.

The rule therefore is that you must treat your characters as entirely
separate -- as though they were owned by different people.  Using one of
your characters to assist another in any way, shape or form is considered
multiplaying and against the rules. Furthermore you must never have more than
one of your characters logged in at the same time.
