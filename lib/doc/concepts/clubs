.SH Description
.SP 5 5
There are two different sorts of clubs on $MUDNAME$, personal clubs and
elected clubs.	Personal clubs are ones that are controlled by one person
and they have the power to change any element of the club they wish to change.
An elected club is run by an elected group of players and they can only
change elements of their clubs by voting.

Elected clubs all start off as personal clubs and cannot be changed to be
elected until they have reached 10 members in a club and a club cannot stay
as a personal club after it has 30 members.  An elected club is given
several advantages over a personal club, elected clubs get a detailed
transaction history of their bank balance, the ability to rent club
rooms and the ability to change various extra elements of the club.

All commands in clubs are prepended by the club name in lower case with
all the spaces replaced with underscores.  For example, if your club is
called 'We Care' then to access the club commands you would use
'we_care'.

Clubs all the have the following features:

Personal clubs can only be up to 30 members in size.  Only people designated
as recruiters are allowed to recruit people into the club.  You can only
deposit into the bank balance of the club, only automatic deductions will

a personal club will be disbanded.

.SH Elected clubs
.SP 5 5
Elected clubs can be over 10 members in size.  People designated as recruiters
and members of the committee can recruit members into the club.  The
treasurer and president can remove money from the bank account,
all members
can get a detailed transaction history of the account.	The president
and the vice president can immediately disbar a member from the club, anyone
can start a discussion item to remove someone from the club.
The president and secretary can add announcements to the club.	Discussion
items can be used to discuss elements of the club, like making the club
secret or changing the names of the various positions in the club and
they can be used as general purpose voting tools.
 An elected club can continue to function after the founder has
left the mud.

Discussion Items control various features of the club.	When a discussion item
is completed, the results are mailed to the committee, and posted to
the bulletin board if the club has one.  A history of all the discussion items
in the club will be kept that can be perused to see what has happened in
the past.  A discussion item is not acted upon unless it has quorum.  For
a committee only discussion item 3/4 of the committee are required to vote
and for an open vote 1/2 of the club are required to vote for it to
have quorum.

A nomination will be accepted if at least two people have nominated a
person and one of those people is the person being nominated.  In other
words the nomination needs to be seconded.  All nominations for positions
in the major elections need to be done in the club control room.  The
commands on your club badges are only for nominating people and voting
for people in discussion items, not general elections.
