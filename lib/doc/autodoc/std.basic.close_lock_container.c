close_lock_container.c

.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This file should be used in containers that wish to notify the
above container that they are able to be registered or not.
The function we_moved(object from, object to) should be called
to allow the object to add and remove itself from the correct
places.


We only worry about the open/close state, if something is open and locked we don't care.  (I guess stuff can be locked open anyway).
