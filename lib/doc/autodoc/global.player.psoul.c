.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This class controls the entire command queue for all player
objects.  Whenever a player tries to execute a command,
it gets placed in a queue here and eventually (during the
player's heart_beat()), the command will (hopefully) be executed.



Since this class is a nexus of control for player commands, it is also the natural place for a number of other utilities and functions which also affect the execution of all commands. Among these are things like drunk_check(), do_soul(), etc.

void command_override(function func)

Use this function to set a function that is called with the players input
before the command handlers get to it, return 1 from the function if the
input needs no further parsing (ie the command is handled)

.SP 7 5

This function will get called when all other commands and actions
have refused to do anything for this input from the user.  This
function adds some extra time for the user, and then returns.

void set_interupt_command(mixed func, mixed ob, mixed arg)
.EI
.SP 7 5

Sets the function to be executed if the command is interrupted.
It is also executed if the command finished.  If it is interrupted
the first argument to the called function will be the amount of time
it had left to complete.  If it complets successfuly, this
argument will be 0.  If the first argument is a function pointer,
this will be used instead.

 Eg: set_interupt_command("frog", TO);

void frog(int time_left, mixed arg) {

.SH Protected Functions
.SP 5 5
These are functions that only objects inheriting the class can access.
.EP

.SI 3
* %^BOLD%^drunk_check%^RESET%^
.EI
.SI 5
int drunk_check(string str)
.EI
.SP 7 5

This poorly named function was originally used to affect the
player's behavior when they are drunk, and to prevent any
player from doing anything in the event that they are passed
out.  Now the function also is responsible for adding commands
to the player's command queue, for implementing the 'stop'
and 'restart' commands, and for ensuring that the player can quit
the game, even when queueing.



To see if a player is passed out, it checks the "passed out" property.  If that property is nonzero, then the player will be prevented from doing the command unless that player is also a creator.  By default, it will print a message that says: "You are unconscious.  You can't do anything.\n".  If the function query_passed_out_message() is defined on the player object (usually by a shadow), and returns a string, then that string is printed instead. 
.EP
.SI 7
%^BOLD%^Parameters:%^RESET%^
.EI
.SP 9 5
str - the command being executed

.EP
.SI 7
%^BOLD%^Returns:%^RESET%^

.SI 5
void flush_queue()
.EI
.SP 7 5

This method flushes all the queued commands.  It increments the time by the
ROUND_TIME define and checks to see if any of the commands now need to be
executed.  This should be called each heart beat..
