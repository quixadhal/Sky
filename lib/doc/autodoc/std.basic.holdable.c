holdable.c

.SH Description
.SP 5 5

A nice file to allow you to setup an object as being holdable.  To deal
with this inheritable you only need to define the method held_this_item
if you wish to do anything when the item is held.

This method is called by the inheritable when the object is change from
being held to unheld, or vica versa.  This should be used to turn on

Attempts to free up enough limbs for this_object to be held.  If
items are dropped to make this possible, who is notified.  If
enough limbs are freed, attempts to hold this_object.  If the position
is undefined (ie: not specified) then it will try and choose a limb
by itself.


The return numbers are the limb numbers that were used by holding the item.
