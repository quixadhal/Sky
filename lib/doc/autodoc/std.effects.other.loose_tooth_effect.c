.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This effect is used in a quest in the Dwarf bread museum.  Simulates
a loose tooth that will be knocked out elsewhere.  Added from eating
dwarf bread.


The effect does not time out.  The argument is an integer of how many 'stages' to advance the looseness of the tooth.  If arg is -1, effect will end with a tooth dropping out if old arg was over 5.
