Inheritable Delivery System


This object provides a way of storing and sending objects to players while they are not online.  It is roughly based on the concepts found in Post Offices that support parcel depositing, and also Bernita's Flower Shop. (Which delivers flowers to people when they log on.) 

This object is easy to use, and can be combined with most other objects on the Disc. (ie, /obj/monster and /std/room). See delivery_room.c for a pre-made room which handles the delivery of objects. 

Note that this system uses static login calls.  These must be configured first and turned on manually in order for the delivery system to work. 

In order to use this inheritable the following things must be done: 
.EP
.SO 5 3 -5

	*	The object that uses it created, and this object inherited. 
	*	The save file set using set_save_file(). 
	*	Any extra settings such as delivery message and delay configured. 
	*	setup_delivery() called on the object to finalize setup.

This method adds the object into the login handler's static login calls
list.  It only ever needs to be called _once_, and doesn't need to be
called every time the object loads.


Once this is done, the object will automatically be loaded whenever someone logs on. 

This must be called in order for the delivery system to work at all.

This method is called when an item is being delivered to a player.  The
delivery message or the burdened mess is used depending on how the item
is delivered, and then it is removed from the delivery mapping.


Note that this routine uses add_message() to display movement messages to the player, instead of tell_object() or a traditional move message. This is so that the messages can be 'clumped' together properly, otherwise it just doesn't work.
