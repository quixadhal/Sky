.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This is a quick and dirty line editor.  Useful when ed fails
or for a few other other things.


 This is a very quick and dirty line editor cooked up by [als] in half an hour on a not-so-stormy night of 10/12/91 It uses NO input_to's, so ALL commands are prefixed with the command word it was simply intended for those times when ed goes down the proverbial gurgler.  If you HAVE to use it, set up aliases :) commands: r file, w[file], >insert text, /search text, number goes to line number, +, -, d, N-> clears line editor Have fun, and win awards One other possible use for LE is for cute aliases
