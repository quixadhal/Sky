Description

This adjusts the current hit points of the thingy.  If the hps are below
0, the object is killed.  Death is tricky.  See help on death in the
concepts dir.  Attacker, Weapon and Attack are optional arguments that
help the death code do fancy things after death occurs.  If you are
in any way shadowing adjust_hp, make sure to add these arguments.
