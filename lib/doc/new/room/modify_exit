int modify_exit(string dir, mixed *arr);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
The modify_exit call is the call you use to change any parameters about
an exit that are not as you have specified with your default.  The dir
is the handle onto the exit you wish to change and the array is an
array of the format

({ type1, param1, type2, param2 ... })

.SP 5 5
The types are from a table given below and the parameter depends on the
type.  With this function you can change all of the settings of exits:
the messages sent when you enter and leave the room, all of the door
settings, and so on.

.SO 5 17 -30
	exit mess	This is the message that is printed when the person exits the room using this exit.  The string should have a $N in it somewhere, eg. "$N womble$s carefully through the tight hole.".	$N is replaced with the short(s) of the object(s) exiting. $F and $T are replaced with the "from" and "to" exit names.	$s can be used to change verbs when multiple objects leave at the same time.  You do not need a \n on the end, but you do need a . if you wish to have one.  There's an old legend that the string must begin with a dummy character, but I've never seen a need for it.

	enter mess	The message printed in the destination room when you go through the exit.  The enter message should be set as a two element array or a string.	The first part of the array is a number specifing if the exit message should have $F expansion done on the string or not.  If it is set to 0 it does.  The other element of the array is the enter string.  If only a string is given, the first element of the array is assumed to be 1.  Like "exit mess", legend says this needs a leading pad character, but it seems to work fine without it.

	enter	An old name for "enter mess".

	move mess	This parameter is a string that is given to the player when moving through the exit.  It should have a \n at the end, since none is added automatically.  No $ expansion is done.

	function	This is a function that is called whenever someone leaves the room using that exit.  This should return 0 if the player was not able to leave through the exit and 1 if he was.  If you wish to print a fail message when the player tries the exit, use notify_fail.  The function can have several formats.  If it is a string it calls the function of that name on the room; if it is an array it calls the function specified in the second element on the object specified in the first element (eg: ({ object, func })).  Function pointers also work.  For guidelines on using exit functions, read help exit_function.

	size	The size of an exit will be used by various items around the mud to see if they can fit through the exit.  Mostly it was intended for use by things like horses, so you can't walk your horse around inside a house or a tight corridor.  The size can also be set to a function, if it is a string or an array it is called every time the size the queryed.

	obvious	This sets whether the exit is obvious or not.  If it is obvious people can see it in the obvious exits description, otherwise it is not shown in this.	Set to 1 to make it show up, and 0 to not make it show up.  It defaults in most cases to 1.  The obvious flag can also be set to a function.  If it is not a integer, but a string or an array it calls the function specified in a similar fashion to the "function" type.

	dest	The destination room of the exit.  Remember to remove the .c at the end of the filename, or doors will tend to break, badly:).

	open	This is used with doors.  It sets whether the exit is open or closed.

	locked	This is also for use with doors.  It sets whether the exit is locked or not.

	autolock	This will make a door automatically lock when it is closed.

	unlockable	This will make the door unlockable.

	key	This is the property used to identify the key.	    If an object returns non zero from the query_property call using the parameter as a property name, the person is allowed to unlock the door.

	other	The other id of the door in the destination room.  This is the door we talk to.

	difficulty	How hard the lock is to pick. The range should normally be 1 to 10 however if necessary larger or smaller numbers could be used.

	undoor	Make something that was a door vanish and make it a non door.

	lock/unlock func	Sets up a function to be called when the door is locked or unlocked.  If the function returns 0 the door is not unlocked, if the function returns 1 it does normal key checking, and if it returns 2 it skips the key checking and (un)locks the door. The function will be called with a single string parameter of "lock", "unlock" or "pick". The parameter passed in modify_exit() is an array with two elements. The first being the object to call the function on and the second the name of the function. ie ({ this_object(), "check_locking" }).

	open/close func	This works basically like the lock/unlock func described above, except the function will be called with a single string parameter of "open" or "close".  If the function returns 1 the transaction is considered successful and the door is opened or closed.

	door long	The long description of the door.

	door short	The short description of the door.  This will also set up all the required adjectives and so on.

	look	A string to be given when a player tries to look through this exit into the next room.

	look func	A function to be called when a player tries to look through to the next room.  There should be 2 parameters, an object and a function name.  The function will be called in the object. e.g. ({ object, func }).

	delta	This can be used to override the calculation of room coordinates from the room size, or to enable coordinate calculation for non-compass exits (eg, "out").  The parameter is a three-element integer array, giving the values that should be added to the current room's coordinates to get the coordinates of the adjoining room; eg, "delta", ({ 100, -150, 0 }) will cause the room at that exit to be 100 feet north and 150 feet west of the current room.  Note that the adjoining room must have a complementary delta for its exit to this room.

	upgrade	The amount this exit goes up.

	downgrade	The amount this exit goes down.

	no follow	This makes people not able to follow others through this exit.
