It is useful when you are editting an object.  Before you clone the object after you make any changes, you must update it or the mud will not realise the change.  Certain other things are equivilant to updating, but it is safer if you just update while you are learning.Update destructs the existing loaded copy if there is one and then loads the new version for you.  If an object is not currently loaded, update will load it for you.
