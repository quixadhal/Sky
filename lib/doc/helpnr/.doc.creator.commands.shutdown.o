It should not be used unless absolutely neccesary.  Lpmud is very good at crashing itself at least every few days, so there should never develop the case where the mud needs to be shutdown.  The mud does gradually slow down as it has been up for a long time, but on a decent machine, you won't notice this.  It also may be neccesary to shutdown if the memory usage gets extremely high, but the mud should be made to do this itself rather than getting creators to shut the mud down manually in this circumstance.  You must supply a reason as to why you are shutting down the mud.
