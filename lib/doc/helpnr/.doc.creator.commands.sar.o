The first usage requires for there to be no spaces in either of the strings.  The second usage allows for spaces.  The ! can be replaced by any other character, as long as it does not occur in either string (if ! is in either string, another character would have to be used).  You can have carriage returns in either of the strings (handy for inserting whole new lines) by representing them by ^M (that's caret M, not control M).  The files can be specified using wildcards.
