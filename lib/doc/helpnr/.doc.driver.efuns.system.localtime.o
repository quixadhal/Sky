In the past time() was used to get the time in GMT (UTC), and then local definitions were used to determine the local offset from GMT.  This roundabout approach is no longer necessary.  localtime() returns the seconds, minutes and hours, the day, month and year, day of the week, day of the year, the name of the local timezone and how far the MUD is from GMT.  This information is retrieved directly from the operating system and made available to the driver without the use of MUD-specific configuration files.localtime() returns an array containing the values specified above.  The index for each value is defined symbolically in localtime.h.  The following table summarizes the array returned by localtime().
