.SH Name
.SI 5
function_exists() - find the file containing a given function in an object 
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
string function_exists( string str, object ob, int flag );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Return the file name of the object that defines the function `str' in
object `ob'.  The returned value can be other than 'file_name(ob)' if the
function is defined by an inherited object.

0 is returned if the function was not defined.

Note that function_exists() does not check shadows.

If `flag' is omitted or zero, functions that cannot be called are not returned
(e.g. the function is returned only if call_other(ob, str) would succeed).
If `flag' is nonzero, static and private functions are returned too.
