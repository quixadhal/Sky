int reclaim_objects( void );

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Cycles through all objects that are loaded, and frees any lingering objects
that it can.  This could result in a sizable amount of memory being freed up,
depending on how the mud is coded.  Objects are typically left lingering
when a global variable in more than one object contains a pointer to it,
and the object gets destructed.  This efun returns the number of destructed
objects encountered in variables.
