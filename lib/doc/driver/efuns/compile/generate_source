.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This efun is only available if LPC_TO_C is defined.

generate_source() calls the LPC->C compiler to generate the source code
for a given object or objects.  If more than one file is passed, a directory
named 'mudlib' is created in the SAVE_BINARIES directory, and that directory
can be copied into the driver source directory and compiled into the driver.

If one file is given, the C source for that file is compiled, and the driver
attempts to link it into the running executable using the RUNTIME_LOADING
option.
