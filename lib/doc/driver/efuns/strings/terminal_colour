terminal_colour() - replaces codes in a string

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
string terminal_colour( string str, mapping m );
string terminal_colour( string str, mapping m, int wrap);
string terminal_colour( string str, mapping m, int wrap,
                        int indent);

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
terminal_colour() replaces each occurrence of %\^key%\^ in `str' with 'value',
where 'key' and 'value' are the elements in the mapping `m'.  You should not
put a '\' in front of the '^' as this page suggests, this was done because
this manual page is wrapped by the same system and it would replace the word
otherwise :-).

`wrap' is the optional column number to wrap at, and `indent' is the
amount to indent the second and following lines.  Codes are assumed to
change the mode of the terminal and not generate any printable
characters for the purposes of wrapping.
