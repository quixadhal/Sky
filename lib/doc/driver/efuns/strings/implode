.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Concatenate all strings found in array `arr', with the string `del' between
each element.  Only strings are used from the array.  Elements that are not
strings are ignored.

The second version takes the first and second values of `arr' and passes them
to `f', then passes that result and the third arg to `f', etc.  It returns
the last result of the call to `f'.

In the third case, the first call is f(start, arr[0]), then things proceed
as above.
