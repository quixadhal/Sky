.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The (ob, fun) syntax works as if (: call_other, ob, fun :) had been passed as
`f'.  Map returns a new structure containing the return values of `f' being
applied to each element of `x'.  Currently, it can be used on arrays,
mappings and strings.  In the case of mappings, both the key and the value
are passed to the function.  In the case of strings, the characters are
passed to the function one at a time as ints.  `extra' and all the following
arguments are passed to the function after the element.
