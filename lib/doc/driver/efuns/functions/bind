.SH Name
.SI 5
bind() - change the owner of a function pointer
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
function bind( function f, object ob )
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
bind() causes function `f' to become owned by object `ob'.  This changes
the value of this_object() when the function pointer is evaluated.  Functions
that reference global variables or functions in the object that created
them cannot be rebound.  Binding a function to the object it is already
bound to will never fail.

Permission to use this efun is controlled by the valid_bind() master apply.
