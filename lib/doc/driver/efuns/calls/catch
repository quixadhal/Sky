.SH Name

catch() - catch an evaluation error
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
mixed catch( mixed expr );
mixed catch { ... };
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Note: catch is really a keyword and not an efun.

The code inside the { ... } or the expression is evaluated.  If there
is no error, catch() returns zero.  If there is an error, a string (with
a leading '*') will be returned.

The function throw() can also be used to immediately return any value,
except 0.

The catch() is somewhat costly, and should not be used just anywhere.
Rather, use it at places where an error would destroy consistency.
