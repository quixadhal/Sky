object load_object( string str );

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Find the object with the file name `str'.  If the object is already
loaded, it is returned (just like find_object()).  If the file exists
and the object hasn't been loaded yet, it is loaded first, then the
new object is returned.  Otherwise zero is returned.  An error is
thrown only if the object has compile errors.
