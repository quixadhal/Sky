get_dir() - returns information pertaining to a filesystem directory

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
mixed *get_dir( string dir );
mixed *get_dir( string dir, int flag );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
If `dir' is a filename ('*' and '?' wildcards are supported), an array of
strings is returned containing all filenames that match the specification.
If `dir' is a directory name (ending with a slash -- i.e.: "/u/", "/adm/", etc),
all filenames in that directory are returned.

If called with `flag' equal to -1, get_dir will return an array
of subarrays, where the format of each subarray is:
.EP

       ({ filename, size_of_file, last_time_file_touched })

.SP 5 5
Where filename is a string and last_time_file_touched is an integer being
number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (same format as time()).  The
size_of_file element is the same value that is returned by file_size(); the
size of the file in bytes, or -2 if it's a directory.
