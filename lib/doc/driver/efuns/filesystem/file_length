.SH Description
.SP 5 5
file_length() returns the number of lines in file `file'.  Size -1
indicates that `file' either does not exist, or that it is not
readable.  Size -2 indicates that `file' is a directory.

Note that this efun is not particularly fast on long files, since
determining the number of lines requires reading the entire file.
