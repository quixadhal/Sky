read_buffer() - read from a file and return a buffer
.EI

.SH Synopsis
.SI 5
mixed read_buffer( mixed src, int start, int len );
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
If `src' is a string (filename), then the filename will be read, starting
at byte # `start', for 'len' bytes, and returned as a buffer.  If neither
argument is given, the entire file is read.

If `src' is a buffer, then characters are read from the buffer beginning
at byte # `start' in the buffer, and for 'len' # of bytes, and returned
as a string.

Note that the maximum number of bytes you can read from a file and into
a buffer is controlled via the `maximum byte transfer' parameter in the
runtime config file.
