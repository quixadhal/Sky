And welcome to the Divided Sky Learning domain.

As you might have noticed, you are now an Apprentice, which means you'll be working on your requirements for the coming period to prove your worth as a Creator.

More information on this can be found in the following helpfiles:

        help creator_start
        help creator_rules
        help newbie creator
        help reqs
        help create

Should you have any more questions, do not hesitate to contact your fellow creators with question. After all, nobody was born knowing how to code.

The best of luck and once again, welcome aboard!

The Divided Sky creator team.
