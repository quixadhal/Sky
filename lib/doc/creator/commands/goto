.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Goto is used to move around the mud quickly.  Instead of walking from room to
room, you can immediately go to any room on the mud by typing goto followed by
its path name either relative to your current dir, or its absolute path from 
the root dir.  You can also goto any living thing by typing goto followed by
the name of the thing you wish to go to.

.SP 5 5
You will ask permission, and ensure you have their consent, before using goto
to go directly to any creator or player.  The only exception to this rule is 
in cases of discipline being handled by liaisons.
