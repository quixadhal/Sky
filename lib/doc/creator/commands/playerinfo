.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Playerinfo is used to print out the player's dossier. This information is
mostly useful for liaisons who want to check the player's behavior history,
punitive measures, item replacements and so on. For each entry in the dossier
the following information is provided: type of the event, time when the event
was recorded, name of the creator who added the entry, and an arbitrary text
describing what happened. Most recent entries are displayed first.

In the special case of "alert" type events, The player will show up (to
creators only) on the login inform:

> [%^GREEN%^Gumboot enters Divided Sky %^BOLD%^%^RED%^1 alert%^RESET%^]

This alert may then be "acknowledged". If the type is not specified, it
will go onto their dossier as a "misc" event. You can specify the type
by using this syntax:
playerinfo <player-name> acknowledge as <type> <event-number> <update>

When you acknowledge an alert, the original information about who added
it and when, and what they said will remain, so all you need to do is
explain what you did to resolve the alert (rather than having to 
paraphrase the original as well).

You can also list the players who have alerts with "playerinfo list alerts",
or list only those who have alerts and are currently online, with
"playerinfo list alerts online".

The player whose dossier is being printed doesn't have to be online. If the
optional event argument is provided, only entries of this type are printed.

The following events are generated automatically:
