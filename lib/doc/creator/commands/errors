.SP 5 5
When run, the command will show the first report in the ERROR_REPORTS file
that is in your current directory, at which time you have a lot of nice
commands of which the most important is "d" which will remove the report
from the file, and send mail to the one who reported the bug.

To edit the relevant file you can use the "e" command if the bug was
reported correctly, or "e filename" if you have to edit some other file.

If you prefer to write your own comments, use the "d r" command which will
take you to the editor.

another dirctory, you can forward it with the "f" command.

To abort without sending any mail or changing the
ERROR_REPORTS file you use "q".
