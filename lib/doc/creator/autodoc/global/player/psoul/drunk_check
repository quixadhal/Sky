.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This poorly named function was originally used to affect the
player's behavior when they are drunk, and to prevent any
player from doing anything in the event that they are passed
out.  Now the function also is responsible for adding commands
to the player's command queue, for implementing the 'stop'
and 'restart' commands, and for ensuring that the player can quit
the game, even when queueing.



To see if a player is passed out, it checks the "passed out" property.  If that property is nonzero, then the player will be prevented from doing the command unless that player is also a creator.  By default, it will print a message that says: "You are unconscious.  You can't do anything.\n".  If the function query_passed_out_message() is defined on the player object (usually by a shadow), and returns a string, then that string is printed instead.
