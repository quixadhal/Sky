.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Read in a random name grammer from the data dir.  Any line with
# at the start is considered a comment, and anything after
a # on a line is ignored.  Every line in the file will have
3 fields seperated by a :.  The first field is the name
the second is a one letter expansion string, the third is a
a space separeted list of things to expand it to.


The word starts off as a "W", this is looked up in the expansion first string list.  If it is found then that is expanded to  a random selection of the space seperated data elements.  This process is repeated until there are no bits in the word that can be expanded.
