.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method gets a guttered item from the armoury.
This is used by the search function in city rooms,
and returns a random smaller item from the armoury's
recycled items list.  The condition percentage should
not be set too high for guttered items, and has been
capped at 50% for that very reason.
