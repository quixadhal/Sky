.SH Description
.SP 5 5

General item retreival function.  It returns a new item
it handles any sort of item.  The percentage is the
percentage condition in which it is returned.
The "word" parameter is the name of the requested item, essentially
the filename without directory and with "_"'s changed to " "'s. The
"percent" parameter is used as measure of how good it
is compared to a fully functional one. So a 50% dagger is only 50% as
good as a 100% one.


The file armoury.h defines the ARMOURY variable.  You need to include this into your file to use it.  You should include this file and uyse ythis define rather than the full path to the armoury, as otherwise your code could stuff up :)
