.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method determines if a player is still active.
If you need to perform this on a lot of players please use the noload
parameter. When noload is set to 1 test_active will not attempt to load
the player file if it isn't currently loaded and will instead just do a
simple calculation of the players last login time. This is less accurate
but avoids lagging the mud.
