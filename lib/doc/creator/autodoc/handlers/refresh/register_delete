.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Use this function to tell the refresh handler about functions that
you want to have called whenever any player refreshes or gets
deleted.

Typically, you will call this by hand, with the 'call' command,
rather than coding a call to this function into your code.

The first parameter is the object that contains the callback
to be called.  This can be either a pointer to the object, or
the filename to the object.

The second parameter is the name of the function that should be
called.  This callback should take one parameter: a string
containing the player's name who's data is being deleted.

This function will refuse to register a callback if either:
the object is a clone, the callback isn't defined in the object, or
the callback is a function pointer.
