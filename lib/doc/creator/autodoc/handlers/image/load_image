.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method reads in the given image file, and returns a two-dimensional
array of integers representing the data in the file.  The 'rle'
flag is currently unused; in the future, it will be used to return
the array in a "run-length encoded" format, where each group of identical
elements in a row will be represented as a count/value pair.  This
may be more efficient for large arrays with sparse data.
