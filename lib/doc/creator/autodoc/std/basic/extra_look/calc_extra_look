.SP 5 5

This method creates the extra long strings based on the current list
of objects to use an extra_look on.  The function extra_look() is
called on every object with TO passed in as the first (and only)
parameter.  If the result is non-zero it is added onto the output.
In case of function pointers, the function pointer will be evaluated
with TO as the argument.
