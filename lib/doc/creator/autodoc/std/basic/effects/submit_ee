.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This submits an effect event schedule.  It will call "function name" in
your effect object after the interval specified in interval_spec, with
behaviour modified by flags.
interval_spec can be one of:

.EP
.SP 5 5
n 
.EP
.SP 8 5
time in seconds 
.EP
.SP 5 5
({ m, n }) 
.EP
.SP 8 5
minimum time m seconds, maximum time n seconds, simple random     distribution 
.EP
.SP 5 5
({ m, n, r }) 
.EP
.SP 8 5
as for the ({ m, n }) case, except the random factor is effectively     "rolled" r times ... the higher r is, the more likely the interval     is to be close to (m + n)/2. 
.EP
.SP 5 5
If the interval is a negative figure, any functions with the     specified function name will be removed from the queue.     This is useful in removing unwanted things from the effects queue. flags may be: 
.EP
.SP 5 5
EE_REMOVE 
.EP
.SP 8 5
remove the effect from the player after the function call 
.EP
.SP 5 5
EE_CONTINUOUS 
.EP
.SP 8 5
do it repeatedly.  Default (EE_ONCE) is only do it once. 
.EP
.SP 5 5
EE_ONCE 
.EP
.SP 8 5
do it once 
.EP
.SP 5 5
These are defined in /include/effect.h 

Only one EE_REMOVE can be in place at a time.  Subsequent EE_REMOVEs will wipe previous ones. 

NB:  submit_ee can ONLY be called from the effect object itself in the course of a beginning/handler/end call, or from the effect shadow.
