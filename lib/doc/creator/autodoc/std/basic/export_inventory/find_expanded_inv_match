.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is not designed to be called from outside
the object itself.  It returns the list of objects able to
be matched that are container in containers in the container.
The third parameter is the set of objects the container
must appear in to be used.  This has to be handled sperately
so thet the plural matchin does not return the ones deep
inside your containers.
