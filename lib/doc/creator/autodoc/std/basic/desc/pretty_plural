.SH Description
.SP 5 5

The observer dependant plural.  It was specifical written to
handle money that needed to be displayed over several lines but
only be one object. The way this was achived was if pretty_plural
returns an array then each of the elements of the array is considered
to be a seperate object and displayed accordingly.
