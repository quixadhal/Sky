.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method returns the "indeterminate" short.  This function returns a
string that the message system replaces, when messages are printed, by the
determinate of the object and its short as given by pretty_short. The
string should not be stored, since the object to which it refers may
not later exist; it can be processed with convert_message.


The return of this function needs more processing before the player sees it.  In general you will not need to worry about this.
