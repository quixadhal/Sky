.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method returns an "out-of-a-group" short.
This function returns a string that the message system replaces, when
messages are printed, by a string dependent on the determinate of
the object and its short as given by pretty_short. If the viewer
is not in the same environment as the object or if the determinate is
defined and is not "a " or "an ", that string is the determinate. If
there is more than one object with the same plural as that object in its
environment, then that string is "one of the "; otherwise the
string is "the ". The output from from one_short should not be
stored, since the object to which it refers may not later exist; it can be
processed with convert_message. One_short is mostly used for
referring to a living object when it performs an action independent
of any previous actions.


The return of this function needs more processing before the player sees it.  In general you will not need to worry about this.
