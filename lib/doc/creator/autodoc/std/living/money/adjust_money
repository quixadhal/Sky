.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method adjusts the amount of money the player has.
It redirects the call off the the money object and calls the
adjust_money() function on it.  The amount can be a money
array, in which case it will adjust the size by the members
of the money array.


If the money object doesn't exist yet, this function might create a new money object.  The exception is that if the amount argument is 0, nothing happens.
