This is the method used to get the living object to wear a piece of
armour or clothing.  This is called from inside the armour or clothing
code itself.  It will call the function set_worn_by() on the
armour or clothing and if this returns a non-zero result then it
will add it into the current list of worn types.  Assuming the
type of the armour fits into the allowed list.  It will also
call the functon hold_item on the object if it is required to be
held as well (ie: shield).
