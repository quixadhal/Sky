.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method returns 1 if the creature shouldn't be able to use
closed doors.
By default, any creature is able to move through closed doors
by opening them, so the default value is 0.
If you shadow this method, including a message about why the
player cannot move in a particular direction, is a good idea.
