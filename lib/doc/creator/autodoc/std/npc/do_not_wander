.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method can be temporarily overwritten in NPCs to stop them
wandering under certain circumstances.  For example if someone is
fighting in the room with the NPC, and we want the NPC to watch.
Alternatively to overwriting the function, you can set a "no wander"
property on the NPC.
