.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method sets up the greeting strings to use when
someone enters the room the NPC is in.
This is useful for shopkeepers and more unique NPCs.
$ob$ in greeting strings will be replaced with
the people that are being greeted.

To use a greeting in form of a soul command, please
use an "@" in front of the greeting string. Soul greetings
will be called on each person individually, and it is
possible to set up random souls by separating different
soul commands by a ":" in the greeting string (see example).

It is also possible to use a function instead of a string
greeting.  The function can either be a function
pointer or a string of the following format -
"#file_name:function", and will then be called with
the following arguments - the thing (object) doing
the greeting, and the array of objects to greet.

NOTE : The NPC will only greet those livings he can see,
and that are not ghosts or otherwise dead.
