.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method checks to see if both of the objects are able to do a
pk action on each other.  This will return 1 if they cannot
complete the action, ie: either of them are not player killers.
It will take an object or a string as the first parameter and attempt
to check for pkness, if the off_line flag is set it will even check for
players that are not even logged on.


If an object is passed into this method, it is first checked with the method query_owner_pk_check(), if this returns a non-zero value it is used as the person who owns the object.  This allows objects to be pk checked when they are not players.
