refresh me

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command is one of the options you have when you have run out of
lives, or would just like to start over.

"refresh me" will erase your character and recreate it.  It will be
like you're logging in for the first time with the only things left
intact being your name, age, club memberships and any mudmail you
currently have.

Use with extra care and note that any attempt to recover your equipment is
considered cheating.
