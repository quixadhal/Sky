.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The chfn command lets you change the information that is printed when
someone fingers you.  It prompts you for all the information.  None of it is
compulsory, but the email address is desirable.  If you do not want anyone
other than lords and gods being able to see your email address, just put a
colon before the address, eg :fred@frog.frog.frog.edu

Please note that you can only set your birthday once, so set it to the
correct value the first time around.

.SH Forgotten Passwords
.SP 5 5
For security reasons we will only send replacement passwords to the
address in your finger information.  If you do not set an email address
we cannot reset your password should you forget it.
