.SH Description
.SP 5 5
You are able to configure the stats of your character once.  Stats take the
range of 3 to 21, and the maximum sum of stat points is 65.  You can make your
stats what you want them to be by typing rearrange and following the
instructions.  The idea of this command is to make your character what you
want it to be.  You should also read the help file on stats to find out what each
of them does.  Don't play with this until you have decided what you want your
character to be like.

You do not need to rearrange your stats very early on in the game, spend
some time playing with your character and get the feel of how things
work before you make a decision about how you wish to set your stats.
