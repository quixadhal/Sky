.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command lets you hold weapons, shields and other things like torches,
which need a hand to be useful.  There is no need for wielding weapons
as holding them basically does this.  If you wield a weapon in your non
prime hand (it defaults to putting things in your prime hand, that's
a hint) it will do less damage than if it is in your prime hand.

You can wield two weapons, one in each hand.  But again they will do
less damage each than if you were wielding just one.  You can also
use this command to hold shields in specific hands.  If you wear a
shield it will use any free limbs you have.
