.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command can be used to get help on concepts, commands, spells or
objects.  If you type help by itself it will give you a list of the
concept help available to you.

All spells and commands should also have their own help which you can
read.  Some objects will also have help and going help <object> should
give you this help.

To get help explicitly on a spell or command assuming they clash with
something you can put a spell and command in front of the name.  ie.
'help spell calm'.

Note that the help is being written and maintained by overworked and
stressed creators, so errors may slip in, or things may change without
being reflected in the help.  If you notice something like this, please
report the error with the 'bug help <name>' command.
