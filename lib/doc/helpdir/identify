.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command adds a word or words to those that can be used to
describe an object, while some identifiers will be used in certain
ways by the game.  Items that have had an indicator specified are
shown as such by "locate".  An item's identifier is preserved over
logins, but not if the item leaves your inventory at any time.

Note: Leaving your inventory includes being put into a scabbard or
a container such as a backpack.  If you can't see it when you check
your inventory with 'i' or 'inventory' then it has left your
inventory.

The 'identify <object>' syntax will show the current identifier (if any)
for the object.
