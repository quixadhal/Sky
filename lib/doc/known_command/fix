.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to fix up weapons and armour which have
been damaged through their use in combat.  If your bonus in
crafts.carpentry.weapons for wooden weapons or armour,
crafts.smithing.black.weapons for metal weapons and
crafts.smithing.black.armour for metal armour is high enough for the
job, you may be able to repair the item completely; otherwise
you will only be able to repair it a little at a time.  You
will be charged an amount of money for materials that you use.
This cost depends on how much you are able to fix the item,
how much it is worth and where you do the fixing - you must be
in a smithy.  The cost of repairs will also be more for an item
with a lower all-time minimum condition.
