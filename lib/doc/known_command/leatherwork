.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to patch up leather goods.  Depending on the
extent of damage, simple sewing may succeed in fixing it, or leather
may have to be tanned, cut and sewed into place, which will, of
course, be rather more expensive.  If the item is not too badly
damaged then the skill crafts.materials.weaving will be used to fix
the item, if it is very badly damaged then the skill
crafts.materials.tanning will be used instead.
