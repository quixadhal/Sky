Done something wrong and have a guilty conscience?
Something gone wrong, and you need a hand?
Liaisons are the warm and fuzzy people who help those in need
and hinder those that break the rules. Pretty much anytime
interaction between creators and players is needed, call on
one of us.

Use the 'liaisons' command to see which (if any) liaison creators are logged in.
