The playtesters domain is currently open for applications until further notice.

To apply, simply go to the playtesters room in the Calarien City Hall, and follow the instructions there.  Amongst other things you will be asked the following things:

1) Why you should be hired as a playtester on Divided Sky.

2) Which parts of the mud you are most interested in seeing developed.

3) The names of up to three people who can vouch for you.  These three people can be either players or creators (except creators in the playtesters domain itself).

Creator Information:  Anything being added to playtesting MUST be approved by a lord of the playtesters domain FIRST.  And most importantly, everything must also be approved by a lord of the playtesters domain BEFORE it leaves playtesting.  If you have any questions, please mail the lords of the domain.
